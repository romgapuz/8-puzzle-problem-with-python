# 8-puzzle problem with BFS and A* Search Algorithms in Python

The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle game where the objective is to rearrange a set of 8 numbered tiles in a 3x3 grid to match a given goal configuration. In this Python code, we are solving the 8-puzzle problem using two (2) popular search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* Search.

At the end we benchmark each algorithms with increasing problem complexity and compare their performance.
